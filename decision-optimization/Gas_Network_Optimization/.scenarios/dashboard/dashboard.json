Gas quantities defined by these scenarios can be transported through the network. Hence the optimization below for \"Transport Scenarios 1+2 (scale by 1.00)\" does not select any extensions which should be added to the network and investment cost are 0. \nWhen scaling the transport scenarios by a factor of 1.75 (this means to multiply each supply or deman value by this factor) the optimization shows different results. In this case extension4 is an optimal selection to be added to the gas network in order to transport the gas quantities of transport scenario 1. Extension2 and Extension3 are an optimal selection to be added to the gas network in order to transport the gas quantities of transport scenario 2. When considering both scenarios in the same optimization step, then extension1, extension2, extension3 can be added to the gas network in order to transport gas quantities defined by the transport scenarios while there is no need to build extension4. Investment cost for this multiple scenario optimization are lower (949.82 Mio. €) compared to a separate optimization for each transport scenario individually (378.87 Mio. € + 778.49 Mio. € = 1,157.36 Mio. €). In summary, multiple scenario optimization saves about 200 Mio. € in this case.","style":{}}}},"layouts":{"SM":[{"w":1,"h":2,"x":0,"y":0,"i":"3fc5ee9c-85fc-469e-b3fd-af68b7132d42","moved":false,"static":false},{"w":1,"h":2,"x":0,"y":2,"i":"837c2852-8f6f-4520-9b76-154f3a9b78cf","moved":false,"static":false},{"i":"bb85b0f4-0df2-4e88-8be6-f9a4dd7bf2e6","x":0,"y":4,"w":1,"h":2,"moved":false,"static":false}],"MD":[{"i":"3fc5ee9c-85fc-469e-b3fd-af68b7132d42","x":0,"y":0,"w":1,"h":2,"moved":false,"static":false},{"i":"837c2852-8f6f-4520-9b76-154f3a9b78cf","x":1,"y":0,"w":1,"h":2,"moved":false,"static":false},{"i":"bb85b0f4-0df2-4e88-8be6-f9a4dd7bf2e6","x":2,"y":0,"w":1,"h":2,"moved":false,"static":false}],"LG":[{"w":5,"h":2,"x":0,"y":4,"i":"3fc5ee9c-85fc-469e-b3fd-af68b7132d42","moved":false,"static":false},{"w":5,"h":2,"x":0,"y":2,"i":"837c2852-8f6f-4520-9b76-154f3a9b78cf","moved":false,"static":false},{"w":5,"h":2,"x":0,"y":0,"i":"bb85b0f4-0df2-4e88-8be6-f9a4dd7bf2e6","moved":false,"static":false}]}}],"breakpoints":[{"name":"SM","width":0,"columns":1},{"name":"MD","width":480,"columns":3},{"name":"LG","width":960,"columns":6}],"rowHeight":120,"extensions":[]}
